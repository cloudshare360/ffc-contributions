Create a AWS NodeJS Lambda, create multiple tables with one to one, one to many, many to many, many to one using orm sequelize;  generate the scheme and data using sequelize, I am create a flight communication app similar to to Microsoft teams, at flight airport, I have zones, zones has multiple gates, when flight lands, multiple users viz., agents, clearers, maintenance of the flight, tower users will communicate with this app. Create a model based the relationships. Sequelize will connect to PostgreSQL as Database. Once generate the lambda code, for creating model, inserting data, need to search users by user id using sequelize.findByPK. Generate unit testcases using jest. Extend the lambda code with express to run locally. Include the instructions as part of readme.md; provide the link to download the code as zip file so that I can run locally and test it, also add docker, docker compose file to connect to PostgreSQL DB with pgadmin ui. Include this file with in the zip file. The application should first start docker-compose file start Postgres DB and pgadmin UI, the fist lambda will be invoked and create the scheme, the second lambda will insert the data, the 3rd lambda will fetch the data based on their relationships.
For each relation type generate separate lambda.
