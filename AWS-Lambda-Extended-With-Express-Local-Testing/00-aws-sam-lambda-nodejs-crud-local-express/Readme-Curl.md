Here are some sample `curl` commands you can use to test each CRUD operation of your AWS Node.js Lambda application, assuming it's running locally on port 3000 or deployed to an AWS environment with a provided API endpoint. You'll need to replace `http://localhost:3000` with your actual deployed API URL or `localhost:3000` for local testing.

### Create Item

This command sends a POST request to create a new item in the database.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/items" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Test Item", "description": "This is a test item created via curl."}'
```

### Read Item

Assuming you know the ID of the item you want to read (replace `<item-id>` with the actual item ID), this command fetches it.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/items/<item-id>"
```

### Update Item

This command sends a PUT request to update an existing item. Again, replace `<item-id>` with the actual ID of the item you want to update.

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3000/items/<item-id>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Updated Test Item", "description": "This is an updated test item via curl."}'
```

### Delete Item

This command sends a DELETE request to remove an existing item from the database. Replace `<item-id>` with the ID of the item you wish to delete.

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/items/<item-id>"
```

### Using the Commands

1. **Create an Item**: First, use the Create Item command. Note the `id` returned by this command.
2. **Read the Item**: Use the Read Item command with the `id` you noted.
3. **Update the Item**: Use the Update Item command with the same `id`.
4. **Delete the Item**: Finally, use the Delete Item command to remove the item.

These curl commands provide a direct way to test the CRUD functionality of your serverless application using a terminal or command line interface. Make sure your server (local or remote) is running and accessible from where you execute these commands.
