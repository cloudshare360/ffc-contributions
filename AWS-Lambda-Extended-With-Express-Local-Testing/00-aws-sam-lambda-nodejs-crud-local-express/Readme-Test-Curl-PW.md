To facilitate testing of your AWS Node.js Lambda application with CRUD operations on Windows, I'll provide sample `curl` commands for each CRUD operation that you can use directly from Command Prompt or PowerShell. These samples will include appropriate JSON payloads for each operation.

### Sample `curl` Commands for Windows

#### 1. **Create Item**
This command creates a new item in the database.

**Command Prompt**:
```cmd
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/items" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"Sample Book\", \"description\": \"A captivating novel about the journey of life.\"}"
```

**PowerShell**:
```powershell
curl -Method Post -Uri "http://localhost:3000/items" -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"name":"Sample Book", "description":"A captivating novel about the journey of life."}'
```

#### 2. **Update Item**
This command updates an existing item. Replace `<item-id>` with the actual item ID.

**Command Prompt**:
```cmd
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3000/items/<item-id>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"Updated Sample Book\", \"description\": \"An updated description of the captivating novel.\"}"
```

**PowerShell**:
```powershell
curl -Method Put -Uri "http://localhost:3000/items/<item-id>" -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"name":"Updated Sample Book", "description":"An updated description of the captivating novel."}'
```

#### 3. **Read Item**
To read an item, you just need the item's ID.

**Command Prompt**:
```cmd
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/items/<item-id>"
```

**PowerShell**:
```powershell
curl -Method Get -Uri "http://localhost:3000/items/<item-id>"
```

#### 4. **Delete Item**
This command deletes an existing item using its ID.

**Command Prompt**:
```cmd
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/items/<item-id>"
```

**PowerShell**:
```powershell
curl -Method Delete -Uri "http://localhost:3000/items/<item-id>"
```

#### 5. **Display All Items**
This command retrieves all items from the database.

**Command Prompt**:
```cmd
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/items"
```

**PowerShell**:
```powershell
curl -Method Get -Uri "http://localhost:3000/items"
```

### General Guidelines

- **Use the Correct URL**: If testing locally, use `localhost:3000`. If testing against a deployed instance, replace `"http://localhost:3000"` with your API's base URL.
- **Handling IDs**: When using update and delete commands, make sure to replace `<item-id>` with the actual ID of the item you are targeting.
- **Command Differences**: Note the slight syntax differences when using `curl` in Command Prompt versus PowerShell.

These commands will help you test each CRUD operation from your Windows environment using either Command Prompt or PowerShell. Adjust the endpoints and details as needed based on your specific deployment or local setup.
